The CoppeliaSim simulator This is an integrated software which includes several physic engines (Bullet is a free version included in it) as well as the Lua interface to control the scene. It has a GUI to control it, but but it's possible to associate LUA child scripts to the component and joints to simulate sensors and actuators depending on the application.
