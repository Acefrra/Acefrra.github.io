This was the 2020 Spring Project for the course of Control Design held by professor H. Sinan Bank at California State University, Chico.

The aim of the project is to explore the possible ways to implement and test an autonomous controller. The controller has been implemented in Matlab and to test it, the robotic simulator CoppeliaSim has been used to build the scene.
