So it has been possible to swing-up the pendulum. Balance the system and follow a given reference. The requirement over the settling time and overshoot were:

Desired Overshoot:
    10

Desired Settling Time:
    3

What we measured in Matlab was:

Measured Percentage Overshoot:
    8.6627

Measured Settling Time:
    3.0900

So the specifications are met.
