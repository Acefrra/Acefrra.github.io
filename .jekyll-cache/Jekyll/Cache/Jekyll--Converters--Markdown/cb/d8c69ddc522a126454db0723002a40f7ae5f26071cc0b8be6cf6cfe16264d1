I"Y<p>The CoppeliaSim simulator allows to create physical scenes in order to simulate physical systems. The single part can be controlled within the environment, both via the GUI or by writing Lua code. Infact it simulates the mechanics, but it’s possible to associate child scripts to the component and joints to simulate sensors and actuators depending on the application.</p>

<p>The software is integrated within other environments like Matlab or Python, which allows to exploit the tons of libraries of computation power they have.</p>
