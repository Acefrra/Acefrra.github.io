I"£<p>The Furuta Pendulum is a very well known process. It was developed for the first time by Furuta and his collegues. It is made up of a rotating arm on an horizontal plane actuated by a motor (in our case a DC motor). This arm is connected with a vertical one (the pendulum) which is free to rotate about the axis of its parent link. It is an underactuated robot, since the system has 2 degrees of freedom, but only one is controlled by a motor.</p>
