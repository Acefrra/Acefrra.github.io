I"¥<p>It has been possible to balance the pendulum at its upright position. However as we discussed the control will be effective only if the configuration is close to the upright due to the Taylor approximation.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to develop a controller that brings the pendulum to the equilibrium point. So that it would be possible to apply the balancing control. This controller is known as <strong>Energy-Shaping Controller</strong> and in this specific case it is called <strong>Swing-Up Controller</strong>, as it is able to swing up the pendulum from the downright position.</p>

<p>These type of controller is energy based. Infact it applies a control to increase the energy up until it reaches the target. In our case the target is the energy when the pendulum is upright. The energy of the pendulum is given by the two components:</p>

\[E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}J_{p}\dot\alpha^{2}\]

\[E_{p} = \frac{1}{2}m-{p}gL_{p}(1-cos(\alpha))\]

\[E = E_{k} + E_{p} = \frac{1}{2}J_{p}\dot\alpha^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_{p}gL_{p}(1-cos(\alpha))\]

<p>We want to reach the energy of the pendulum when it is up with no velocity, so when:</p>

\[E = E_{p} (\alpha = 0) = 0\]

<p>The energy based controller will apply a torque until the difference between the reference energy \(E_{d}\) and the current energy \(E\) is small.
To apply this technique it is necessary to express the energy of the non-actuated link as function of the input of the system.</p>

<p>In general this is obtained by using a PFL (Partial Feedback Linearization) in order to get an equation of motion where there is only the angle of the nonactuated link and an input \(u\) of the system. However, in this case Quansar built a more simple equation of motion using a simplified model: [1] <!--Cite to the A NEW STRATEGY FOR SWINGING UP AN INVERTED PENDULUM M. Wiklund, A.

\[J_{p}\ddot\alpha + \frac{1}{2}m_{p}gL_{p}sin(\alpha) - 1/2m_{p}L_{p}ucos(\alpha) =  0\]

<p>Where u is proportional to the torque \(\tau\):</p>

\[\tau = m_{r}L_{r}u\]

<p>At this point \(\tilde E = E- E_{d} = E\) and so:</p>

\[\dot{\tilde E} = \dot \alpha(J_{p}\ddot \alpha + 1/2m_{p}gL_{p}sin(\alpha))\]

<p>And by substituing sin(\alpha) we get</p>

\[\dot E = -m_p u L_{p} \dot\alpha cos(\alpha)\]

<p>So if the control u is:</p>

\[u = k\tilde Esign(\dot \alpha cos(\alpha))\]

<p>Where k is a gain to tune. This guarantees that \(\dot E \propto -E\) and so that \(E -&gt; 0\).</p>

<p>The voltage to feed to the DC motor will be:</p>

\[V_{m} = sat(\frac{R_{m}L_{r}u}{\eta_{g}K_{g}\eta_{m}k_{t}} + K_{g}k_{m} \dot \theta )\]

<p>\(V_m\) must be limited due to the actuator saturation.</p>
