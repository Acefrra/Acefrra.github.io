I"î<p>Even though we got the A and B matrixes, they are still parametric. To get them numerical in Maple we do:</p>

<p><code>
A_data := subs(data, A);
<br /><br />
B_data := subs(data, B);
<br /><br />
</code></p>

<p>After this we got the matrixes:</p>

\[A_{data} := \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 34.69 &amp; -17.54 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 62.26 &amp; -13.59 &amp; 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}\]

\[B_{data} := \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    32.97 \\
    25.56
    \end{pmatrix}\]

<p>with maple is possible to compute the eigenvalues with:</p>

<p><code>
    Eigenvalues(A_data);
</code></p>

<p>and we get the four eigenvalues \(\lambda_{1} = 0, \lambda_{2} = -19.10 , \lambda_{3} = 6.53, \lambda_{4} = -4.97\). As it can be seen there is one eigenvalue with real part positive. It can be proved that this point is <strong>not locally asymptotically stable</strong>.</p>

<p>Neverthless, if we can stabilize this system and put all the eigenvalues inside the left complex plane for example by exerting a full state feedback, the system is going to <strong>be locally asymptotically stable</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to that it is necessary that the system is reachable that is the reachability matrix:</p>

\[R = \begin{pmatrix} A &amp; A^{2}B &amp;...&amp; A^{n}B \end{pmatrix}\]

<p>is full rank. In our case, n = 4. With Maple this is code to verify that:</p>

<p><code>
R := Concatenate(2, A_data, A_data.B_data, A_data^2.B_data, A_data^3.B_data];       #2 means to merge the matrixes along columns.
<br /><br />
rank(R);
</code></p>

<p>since it is 4, the system is <strong>reachable</strong>. Thus the system is <strong>stabilizable</strong>. As a result, it will be possible to find the matrix K.</p>
