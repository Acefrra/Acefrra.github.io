I"¥<p>The model of the system is from Quansar. To model the system they used a lagrangian approach. To do that it is necessary to describe the configuration of the sytem with the lagrangian coordinates \([q_{1}, q_{2}, ...... q_{n}]\) with \(n = d.o.f\).</p>

<p>They decided to describe the system with the angles \([\theta(t) , \alpha(t)]\), with the angles positive for CCW rotations of the pendulum,. The angle alpha is measured from the positive \(z\) semi-axis.</p>

<p>then they wrote down the lagrangian equation:</p>

\[\frac{\delta L}{\delta t \delta q_{i}} - \frac{\delta L}{\delta q_{i}} = Q_{i}\]

<p>Where L = T - V is the lagrangian function, with T kinetic energy and V is the potential energy of the whole system whilst \(Q_{i}\) are the generalized non-conservative forces acting on the entire system with respect to the coordinate \(q_{i}\).</p>

<p>For the rotary arm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>itâ€™s massless, with inertia \(J_{r}\);</li>
  <li>length \(L_{r}\);</li>
</ul>

<p>For the pendulum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inertia \(J_{p}\);</li>
  <li>it has a lumped mass \(m_{p}\) positioned at \(\frac{L_{p}}{2}\);</li>
  <li>length \(L_{p}\);</li>
</ul>

<p>We have 2 differential equations of motion:</p>

\[\frac{\delta L}{\delta t \delta \theta} - \frac{\delta L}{\delta \theta} = Q_{1}\]

\[\frac{\delta L}{\delta t \delta \alpha} - \frac{\delta L}{\delta \alpha} = Q_{2}\]

<p>with \(Q_{1} = \tau - B_{r} \dot{\theta}\) and \(Q_{2} = -B_{p}\dot{\alpha}\), where \(B_{r}\) and \(B_{p}\) are the coefficent of viscous friction, and \(\tau\) is the torque applied by the attached motor.</p>

<p>As a result the equations of motion are obtained:</p>

<div style="overflow:auto;">
$$(m_{p}L^{2}_{r} +\frac{1}{4}m_{p}L_{p}^{2} - \frac{1}{4}m_{p}L_{p}^{2}cos(\alpha)^{2} + J_{r})\ddot{\theta} - (\frac{1}{2}m_{p}L_{p}L_{r}cos(\alpha))\ddot{\alpha}+(\frac{1}{2}m_{p}L_{p}^{2}sin(\alpha)cos(\alpha))\dot{\theta}\dot{\alpha}+(\frac{1}{2}m_{p}L_{p}L_{r}sin(\alpha))\dot{\alpha}^{2} = \tau - B_{r}\dot{\theta}$$
