I"¢<p>Here is the demo of the program:</p>

<p>So it has been possible to swing-up the pendulum. Balance the system and follow a given reference. The requirement over the settling time and overshoot were:</p>

<p>Desired Overshoot:
    10</p>

<p>Desired Settling Time:
     3</p>

<p>What we measured in Matlab was:</p>

<p>Measured Percentage Overshoot:
    8.6627</p>

<p>Measured Settling Time:
    3.0900</p>

<p>So the specifications are met.</p>
