I"ë<p>The Furuta Pendulum is a very well known process. It is made up of a rotating arm on an horizontal plane actuated by a motor (in our case a DC brushless motor), connected with a vertical arm (the pendulum). It is an underactuated robot, since the system has 2 degrees of freedom, but only one is controlled by a motor.</p>
