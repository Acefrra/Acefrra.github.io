I"x<p>The gain controller K is gonna be built over a LTI system which is of the form:</p>

\[\begin{cases} \dot x(t) = A x(t) + B u(t) \\ y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t)\end{cases}\]

<p>Where x(t) is the state, u(t) is the input and y(t) is the output. \(x(t) \in \R^{n}\), \(u(t) \in \R^{m}\) and \(y(t) \in \R^{p}\). A is the matrix of the dynamic, B of the input, C of the output. \(A \in \R^{n \times n}\) , \(B \in \R^{n \times m}\) , \(C \in \R^{p \times n}\) , \(D \in \R^{p \times m}\). The state equations is a system of linear differential equation of first order. The equations of motion we got are second order and they are not linear.</p>

<p>The first step is to reduce them to</p>

<p>We can add the other two differential equations of first order:</p>

\[\begin{cases} \dot \alpha(t) = \alpha_{dot}(t) \\ \dot \theta(t) = \theta_{dot}(t) \end{cases}\]

<p>In this way we easily get rid of \(\ddot \alpha(t)\) and \(\ddot \theta(t)\).</p>
