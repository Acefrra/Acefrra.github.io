I" <p>The model of the system is from Quansar. To model the system they used a lagrangian approach. To do that it is necessary to describe the configuration of the sytem with the lagrangian coordinates, then they wrote down the lagrangian equation:</p>

\[\frac{\delta L}{\delta t \delta q_{i}} L\]

<p>Where L = T - V is the lagrangian function, with T kinetic energy and V is the potential energy of the whole system whilst \(Q_{i}\) are the generalized non-conservative forces with respect to the coordinate \(q_{i}\)</p>
