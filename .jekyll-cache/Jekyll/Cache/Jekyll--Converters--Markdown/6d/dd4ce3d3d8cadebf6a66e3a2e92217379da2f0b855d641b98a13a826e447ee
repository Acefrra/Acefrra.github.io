I"ý<p>Here is the demo of the program:</p>

<p>So it has been possible to swing-up the pendulum. Balance the system and follow a given reference. The requirement over the settling time and overshoot were:</p>

<p>Ts = 3s and %OS = 10%.</p>

<p>The expected met specifications were:</p>

<p>Closed Loop Overshoot
   10.3725</p>

<p>Closed Loop Settling Time
    2.8432</p>

<p>What we measured in Matlab was:</p>

<p>Measured Percentage Overshoot:
    8.6627</p>

<p>Measured Settling Time:
    3.0900</p>

<p>So the specifications are met.</p>
