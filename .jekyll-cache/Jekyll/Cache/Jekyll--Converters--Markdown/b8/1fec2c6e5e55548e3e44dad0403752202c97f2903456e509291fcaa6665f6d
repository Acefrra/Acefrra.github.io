I"<p>The model of the system is from Quansar. To model the system they used a lagrangian approach. To do that it is necessary to describe the configuration of the sytem with the lagrangian coordinates \([q_{1}, q_{2}, ...... q{n}]\) with \(n = d.o.f\).</p>

<p>They decided to describe the system with the angles \([\theta(t) , \alpha(t)]\), with the angles positive for CCW rotations of the pendulum,. The angle alpha is measured from the positive \(z\) semi-axis.</p>

<p>then they wrote down the lagrangian equation:</p>

\[\frac{\delta L}{\delta t \delta q_{i}} - \frac{\delta L}{\delta q_{i}} = Q_{i}\]

<p>Where L = T - V is the lagrangian function, with T kinetic energy and V is the potential energy of the whole system whilst \(Q_{i}\) are the generalized non-conservative forces acting on the entire system with respect to the coordinate \(q_{i}\).</p>

<p>For the rotary arm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>itâ€™s massless, with inertia J_{r};</li>
  <li>length L_{r};</li>
</ul>

<p>For the pendulum</p>

<ul>
  <li>inertia J_{p};</li>
  <li>it has a lumped mass positioned at \(\frac{L__{p}}{2}\);</li>
  <li>length
During the modeling they assumed the rotary arm to be massless and with an inertia of J__{r}. , while the pendulum having a mass Jp and a mass mp.</li>
</ul>
